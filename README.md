I was messing around with my drawings and noticed one of them looked like a jellyfish from SpongeBob, so I decided to go with an under-the-sea theme. I added seaweed and whales and aimed to create a jolly, fun vibe with the music. I also wanted to use pink as the main color, so the game is mostly pink. I know that jellyfish can swim in real life, that doesnâ€™t really matter in the world of my game.
